> Behavioral Pattern: Memento Pattern.

The Memento design pattern defines three distinct roles:
* Originator - the object that knows how to save itself.
* Caretaker - the object that knows why and when the Originator needs to save and restore itself.
* Memento - the lock box that is written and read by the Originator, and shepherded by the Caretaker.
