> Introduce Sqrt Decomposition and how to use this approach in solving algorithm questions.

## 1. Sqrt Decomposition
Sqrt Decomposition is a method that allows you to perform some common operations in $O(\sqrt{k})$ operations, which is much faster than $O(n)$ for the trivial algorithm. For example, find sum of the elements of the sub-array, find the minimal/maximal element, etc.
