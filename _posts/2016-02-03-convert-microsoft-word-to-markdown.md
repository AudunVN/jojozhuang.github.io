After I setup [this personal website](http://jojozhuang.github.io/) on github, I post blogs and portfolios aperiodically. It's great to use markdown to edit page content. However, it is not easy to add images into the page.

I still prefer Microsoft's Office Word as my favorite text editor. I wonder whether there is a tool to convert Word format(.docx) to markdown format(.md). It's not hard to find such tool [Writage](http://www.writage.com/). Actually, it is a plugin for Office Word.

How to get it? Download [Writage](http://www.writage.com/) from [http://www.writage.com/](http://www.writage.com/). Before install it, you need to install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) first.

How it works? You can edit docx file as usual, and save it to markdown(.md) file. The styles in the word will be kept in markdown file. So simple and easy to use. Another reason why I like it so much is that it can export images with the same size as in Word. This saves me lots of time to edit the pictures.

Besides, [Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) shows how to use Markdown to create your document.

Hope you enjoy this tool as well.

Please Note: Sometimes you see few images in your posting are too large and make the page looks ugly. It's better to resize these images. For example, change their width from 1024px to 600px and keep the proportion with height.
