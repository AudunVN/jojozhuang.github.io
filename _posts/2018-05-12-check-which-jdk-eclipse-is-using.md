> How to check which JDK Eclipse is using.

To check with what Java version (JRE or JDK) Eclipse is running, do the following:

Open the menu item Help > About Eclipse. (On the Mac, itâ€™s in the Eclipse-menu, not the Help-menu)
Click on Installation Details.
Switch to the tab Configuration
Search for a line that starts with -vm. The line following it shows which Java binary is used.
