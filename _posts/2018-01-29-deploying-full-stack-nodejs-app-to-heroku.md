> Introduce how to deploy React and Node.js app to Heroku.

## 1. Full Stack App
In the posting [Building Online Code Editor]({% link _posts/2018-01-25-building-online-code-editor.md %}), I introduced how to build an online code editor with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). In this posting, I will introduce how to deploy both the front end(React) and backend(Node.js) to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## 2. Heroku
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
### 2.1 Sign Up
Go to https://signup.heroku.com/ create a free Heroku account.
### 2.2 Installing Heroku CLI
Go to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install to download proper installer.
### 2.3 Getting Started
Follow the official document [Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction) to finish the tutorial.
Below are some of the highlights.  
1) Log into Heroku
```sh
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: jojozhuang@gmail.com
Password: **********
```
2) View logs
```sh
heroku logs --tail
```
3) Scale the app
```sh
heroku ps //check how many dynos are running
heroku ps:scale web=0 // scale down
heroku ps:scale web=1 // scale up
```
4) Run the app locally
```sh
heroku local web // same to 'npm start'
```
5) Heroku Console
```sh
$ heroku run bash
Running bash on â¬¢ damp-springs-52045... up, run.3598 (Free)
~ $ ls
Procfile  README.md  app.json  index.js  node_modules  package-lock.json  package.json	public	test.js  views
```
Type 'exit' to quit the console.

## 3. Deployment
### 3.1 Server
**Clone Source Code**
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jojozhuang/Tutorials/tree/master/OnlineCodeEditorReact
$ cd OnlineCodeEditorReact
```
**Create App on Heroku**
```sh
$ heroku create online-code-editor-api
```
* When creating an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with the local git repository.

Deploy code to Heroku.
```sh
$ git push heroku master

 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/online-code-editor-api.git'
```
When the React App was created, both yarn lock file and npm lock file were generated. To fix the error, we need to decide which lock file to use. I decide to use npm, so remove yarn.lock from git and try to push again.
```sh
$ git rm yarn.lock
rm 'yarn.lock'
git commit -m "remove yarn.lock"
[master 7944b7d] remove yarn.lock
 1 file changed, 7423 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 yarn.lock
$ git push heroku master
```
**Testing Server**
Open web browser, access 'https://online-code-editor-api.herokuapp.com/api/file/Java'. The API is working now.

### 3.2 Client
Build react app.
```sh
$ npm run build
```
The front end React app is built and exported to dist folder. All are static files(html, js and images).

Create App on Heroku
```sh
heroku create online-code-editor
```

Create git repository.
```sh
cd dist
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial"
git push heroku master
```

If you changed the app name or you are deploying new changes. You need to re-connect your git repository to Heroku app.
```sh
git remote rm heroku
heroku git:remote -a online-code-editor
```

**Testing Server**  
Open web browser, access 'https://online-code-editor.herokuapp.com/'. The React app is working now.
