This is a CMS web application built with ASP.NET MVC in C# language. I used the template from [AdminLTE Control Panel Template](https://almsaeedstudio.com/) to design the UI pages. The whole website looks very pretty and modern style.  
1. Login Page  
![login](/assets/shoestore/login.png "login")
2. User List. Other list pages have the similar layout.
![index](/assets/shoestore/index.png "index")
3. Reponsive UI for different screen size.  
Full screen size in desktop web browser.  
![fullscreen](/assets/shoestore/responsive.png "fullscreen")
Smaller size in phone web browser.  
![phonesize](/assets/shoestore/responsive2.png "phonesize")
4. Sales order
![order](/assets/shoestore/order.png "order")
