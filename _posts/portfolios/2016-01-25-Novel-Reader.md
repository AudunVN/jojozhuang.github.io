This Outlook style desktop application is used to read novel. One friend of mine likes to read novels through online websites. And he didn't want be noticed by his boss when he was reading at office. So, he asked me whether it is possible to develop a tool to get the online novels into a local program, such as this Outlook mailbox. I searched through out the intenet and found a great UI template and created this tool for him. He was so happy and satisfied with it. It's a long time ago, the website for host the novels are not existed anymore, but I still have a sceenshot when it was working.  

Technically, it sends out http get or post requests to the website, then gets results and display in the tool.

To make it work again, you just need to find a novel website, replace the urls for category list and content.  

You can get the source code from [Github](https://github.com/jojozhuang/Projects/tree/master/NovelReader/Src "Source Code").
