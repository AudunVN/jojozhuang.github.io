This Android app is used to search restaurants, rate and write comments to them. It's built for my final project of course 'CSC472-Mobile App Development for Android'. All the data for this app is dynamically retrieved from backend server.  
1. Home screen  
![index](/assets/resturant/index.png "index")
2. Login/Register  
![signin](/assets/resturant/signin.png "signin")
3. Restaurant Detail.  
![detail](/assets/resturant/detail.png "detail")
After login, you are able to submit rating and share your experience about the restaurant.  
4. View in landscape mode.  
![landscape](/assets/resturant/landscape.png "landscape")
5. Big screen(like Pad) is also supported.

6. Backend data server, which is built with ASP.NET MVC. You can simulate the register, login and logout function here.
