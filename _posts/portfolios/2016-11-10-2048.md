> Convert 2048 from a web application to desktop application for all platforms, OS X, Windows and Linux.

## 1. 2048
2048 is a famous number puzzle game, you can try it online through https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/. It also has iOS and Android versions for mobile devices. I converted it to Desktop application with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/).

## 2. UI
The UI is same with the web application, just click New Game to start and use four arrow keys on keyboard to move the tiles for playing.

## 3. Under the Hood
Check posting [Convert Web App to Desktop App with Electron](http://jojozhuang.github.io/blog/2016/11/08/convert-web-app-to-desktop-app-with-electron/) to learn the details of the conversion with Electron.

Notice, Electron is used to build __cross-platform desktop apps__ with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. To develop __cross-platform mobile apps__, maybe you need [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) or [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) instead.
