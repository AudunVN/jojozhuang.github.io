> Migrate 2048 from a web application to desktop application cross-platform.

## 1. 2048
2048 is a famous number puzzle game, you can try it online at https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/. It also has iOS and Android version for mobile devices. I converted it to Desktop application with Electron.

## 2. UI

The UI is same with the web application, just click New Game to start and use four direction keys on keyboard.
On Mac
