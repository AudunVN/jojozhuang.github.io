This Android app is used to search restaurants, rate stars and write comments to them. It's built for my final project of course 'CSC472-Mobile App Development for Android'. All the data for this app is dynamically retrieved from backend server.  
## 1. Home screen  
![index](/assets/restaurant/index.png "index")
## 2. Login/Register  
![signin](/assets/restaurant/signin.png "signin")
## 3. Restaurant Detail.  
After login, you are able to submit rating of the restaurant and share your experience.

## 5. Big screen(like Pad) is also supported.

## 6. Backend data server, which is built with ASP.NET MVC. You can simulate the register, login and logout function here.
