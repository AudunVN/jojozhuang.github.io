This Android app is used to search restaurants, rate stars and write comments to them. It's built for my final project of course 'CSC472-Mobile App Development for Android'. All the data for this app is dynamically retrieved from backend server.  
1. Home screen  
![index](/assets/restaurant/index.png "index")
2. Login/Register  
![signin](/assets/restaurant/signin.png "signin")
3. Restaurant Detail.  
![detail](/assets/restaurant/detail.png "detail")
After login, you are able to submit rating and share your experience about the restaurant.  
4. View in landscape mode.  
![landscape](/assets/restaurant/landscape.png "landscape")
5. Big screen(like Pad) is also supported.  
![pad](/assets/restaurant/pad.png "pad")
6. Backend data server, which is built with ASP.NET MVC. You can simulate the register, login and logout function here.  
![backend](/assets/restaurant/backend.png "backend")  

You can get the source code from [Github](https://github.com/jojozhuang/Course/tree/master/CSC472/FinalProject/Code "Source Code"). And the [Source Code](https://github.com/jojozhuang/Course/tree/master/CSC472/FinalProject/DataServer "Source Code") for backend server is also available.
