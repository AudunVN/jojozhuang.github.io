This is my final project for course 'CSC471-Mobile App Development for iOS'. This app is used to manage trip itineraries. Two main functionalities are implemented in this prototype. The first is that you can create new trip plan and save it, later you can easily find it and edit it if necessary. The tool also provides the ‘Share’ function which enables you to share your trip to others conveniently via message, email, Facebook, etc. Another major functionality is, searching.  You would be able to search your next destination through the path continent->country->city. In the final ‘City Detail’ screen, you will find lots of useful informations, such as map of the city, local time, local weather, famous sights, etc. If you like, you can save the city to your favorite list. Also, you are able to share it with others.
