This iOS app is used to manage itineraries. It's built for my final project of course 'CSC471-Mobile App Development for iOS'. Classic layout with three tabs: Me, Search and Settings.  
## 1. Home screen  
![index](/assets/travelnote/index.png "index")  
### 1.1 Me -> New Trip
Create new plan for your next trip.
![newtrip1](/assets/travelnote/newtrip1.png "newtrip1")  
![newtrip2](/assets/travelnote/newtrip2.png "newtrip2")  
### 1.2 Me -> My Trips
Find the new created trip in the 'My Trips' list.  
![trips](/assets/travelnote/trips.png "trips")
The app provides the ‘Share’ function which enables you to share your trip to others via message, email or Facebook, etc.

### 1.3 Me -> My Favorites
You can find the cities which you have added into favorite list before.  
![favorite](/assets/travelnote/favorite.png "favorite")
### 1.4 Me -> My Location
You can get the exact coordinates of your current location through 'My Location'.  
![location](/assets/travelnote/location.png "location")  
## 2. Search
Search is another main function. You are able to search your next destination.  
### 2.1 Search -> Continent
![search](/assets/travelnote/search.png "search")  
### 2.2 Search -> Continent-> Country
![countrylist](/assets/travelnote/countrylist.png "countrylist")  
### 2.3 Search -> Continent-> Country -> City
![citylist](/assets/travelnote/citylist.png "citylist")
### 2.4 Search -> Continent-> Country -> City -> Details
In the final ‘City Detail’ screen, you will find lots of useful information, such as map, local time, local weather, famous sights, etc. If you like, you can save the city to your favorite list.  
![city](/assets/travelnote/city.png "city")
