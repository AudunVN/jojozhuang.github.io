data types
Variable	Explanation	Example
String	A sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, you must enclose it in quote marks.	var myVariable = 'Bob';
Number	A number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.	var myVariable = 10;
Boolean	A True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords in JS, and don't need quotes.	var myVariable = true;
Array	A structure that allows you to store multiple values in one single reference.	var myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
Refer to each member of the array like this:
myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.
Object	Basically, anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.	var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
All of the above examples too.
