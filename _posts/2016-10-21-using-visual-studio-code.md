After installation, launch VS Code. Now open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type shell command to find the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.


After executing the command, restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to simply type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder. The "." Simply means "current directory"
```sh
code .
```
