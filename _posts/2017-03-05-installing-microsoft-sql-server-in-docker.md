SQL Server is a database.

## 2. Creating SQL Server Container in Docker
### 2.1 Installing Docker and Kitematic
If you havenâ€™t installed Docker and Kitematic, please install Docker Toolbox by referring to another posting [Install Docker Toolbox and Kitematic on Mac]({% link _posts/2016-09-11-installing-docker-toolbox-and-kitematic-on-mac.md %}).
### 2.2 Creating SQL Server Container

The installation will take several minutes. Finally, the container is created. However, it is stopped. There are some configurations we have to set before using it.
