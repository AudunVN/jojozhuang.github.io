> Introduce how to install and use docker

## 1. What is Docker?
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

Key concepts of Docker: Image, Container and Docker Hub.

## 1.1 Image
In Docker, everything is based on Images. An image is a combination of a file system, tools and configurations.

## 1.2 Container
Containers are instances of Docker images that can be run using the Docker run command. The basic purpose of Docker is to run containers.

## 1.3 Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built by other communities. You can also upload your own Docker built images to Docker hub.

Go to https://hub.docker.com/ to create a Docker ID, then login. You will see there is no repository/image initially. We will create our own image later.

## 2. Install Docker on Ubuntu
1) Add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:
```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
2) Add the Docker repository to APT sources:
```sh
$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```
3) Update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
```
4) Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:
```sh
$ apt-cache policy docker-ce
```
5) Install Docker:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
```
6) Check Docker is Running:
```sh
$ sudo systemctl status docker
```

## 3. Execute the Docker Command Without Sudo (Optional)
By default, running the docker command requires root privileges â€” that is, you have to prefix the command with sudo. It can also be run by a user in the docker group, which is automatically created during the installation of Docker. If you attempt to run the docker command without prefixing it with sudo or without being in the docker group, you'll get an output like this:
```sh
$ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}  // add the current user to the docker group
$ sudo usermod -aG docker username // add a particular user to the docker group
$ su - ${USER}                     // apply the new group membership
$ id -nG                           // check user is now added to the docker group
```

## 4. Use Docker Commands
Syntax of Docker Command
```sh
$ docker [option] [command] [arguments]
```

## 4.1 Generic Docker Commands
```sh
$ docker version        // check version
$ docker info           // check system-wide information about Docker
$ docker search ubuntu  // search image which is named 'ubuntu' from Docker Hub
$ docker pull ubuntu    // download image from Docker Hub to local
```

## 4.2 Commands for Images:
```sh
$ docker images         // list images
$ docker rmi image_name // delete image by name
$ docker rmi image_id   // delete image by id
```

## 4.3 Commands for Containers
```sh
$ docker ps                      // list all active docker containers
$ docker ps -a                   // list all docker containers
$ docker run ubuntu              // run a container with the selected image
$ docker run -it ubuntu          // run a container with the selected image, and access the interactive shell
$ docker stop container-id       // stop a running or active container
$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) // stop all of Docker containers
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)   // remove all of Docker containers
```

## 5. Create Docker Image
We use the office ubuntu image for this demo. We will install node.js on it, then use it to create new image.
## 5.1 Prepare Image
1) First, run the following command to check the existing images in the docker.
```sh
$ docker images
```
![MIME Type](/public/pics/2016-09-10/images1.png)  

2) Then, run the following command to start a container and go to its shell.
```sh
$ docker run -it ubuntu
```
![MIME Type](/public/pics/2016-09-10/shell.png)  

3) Install Node.js In Ubuntu Container.
```sh
$ root@7f5bdefef7ef:/# apt-get update
$ root@7f5bdefef7ef:/# apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Check the node version to make sure the installation is properly completed.
```sh
$ root@7f5bdefef7ef:/# nodejs -v
```

## 5.2 Create New Image
1) First, type 'exit' to quit the container. Then check the container id with following command.
```sh
$ docker ps -a
```
This command shows all of the existing containers. As you see, there is only one ubuntu container is running, which we just install node.js on it. Note down the container id.
![MIME Type](/public/pics/2016-09-10/checkcontainer.png)  

2) Now, we are ready to create our own image.  
Syntax of creating new image.
```sh
$ docker commit -m "What did you do to the image" -a "Author Name" container-id repository/new_image_name
```

Type the following command.
```sh
$ docker commit -m "added node.js" -a "Johnny" 7f5bdefef7ef jojozhuang/ubuntu-nodejs
```
* 'jojozhuang' is my Docker ID which is used to log into Docker Hub.
* '7f5bdefef7ef' is the container id of the ubuntu container.

Show the image list to check whether our new image is created.
```sh
$ docker images
```
![MIME Type](/public/pics/2016-09-10/createimage.png)  
As you see, a new image named 'jojozhuang/ubuntu-nodejs' has been created. Notice that its size is bigger than the original ubuntu image. This is because we install node.js into it.

## 5.3 Use Dockerfile to Create New Images
Refer to the following blogs:
* [Create Tomcat Image with Docker File]({% link _posts/2016-09-25-create-tomcat-image-with-docker-file.md %})
* [Create Mysql Image with Docker File]({% link _posts/2016-09-27-create-mysql-image-with-docker-file.md %})

## 6. Push Docker Images to Docker Hub
## 6.1 Log into Docker Hub
Syntax of login command.
```sh
$ docker login -u username
```
Type command as follows, then input password.
```sh
$ docker login -u jojozhuang
```
![MIME Type](/public/pics/2016-09-10/login.png)  

## 6.2 Push the Image
Syntax of push command.
```sh
$ docker push docker-registry-username/docker-image-name
```
Type command as follows, providing the full name of the new image.
```sh
$ docker push jojozhuang/ubuntu-nodejs
```
Then, docker starts to upload the image to its hub.

After the push is completed, you will see the 'Pushed' status.

## 6.3 Check The New Image in Docker Hub
Log into the Docker Hub, we see there is a new image.
![MIME Type](/public/pics/2016-09-10/newimageonhub1.png)  
Now, you can share this image to others and you can pull this image from Docker Hub as well.

## 7. Pull The New Image from Hub to Mac
Launch Docker Terminal on Mac, run the following command to pull the new image.
```sh
$ docker pull jojozhuang/ubuntu-nodejs
```
Run the following command to start the container and go to its shell.
```sh
$ docker run -it jojozhuang/ubuntu-nodejs
```
Check the nodejs version.
```sh
$ nodejs -v
```
![MIME Type](/public/pics/2016-09-10/pull.png)  
Yes, it's our image!
