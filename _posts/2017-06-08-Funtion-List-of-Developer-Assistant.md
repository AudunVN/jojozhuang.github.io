> I plan to develop a tool which helps to create file, manipulate strings, etc. It should be cross-platform, using Node.js maybe. Here are the functionalities I can imagine.

Take a look how Atom is built.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor))

## 1. File Creation
  * Create files with same or similar content.
  * Create files with same or similar file name.
  * Convert xml file to csv format

## 2. String Manipulation
  * Convert Base64 or vice versa.
  * Html encoding and decoding.
  * Append same string as prefix for all lines.
  * Append same string as suffix for all lines.
  * Add new line(\r\n) to each clause(eg. end with period)
  * Extract full name from each line
  * Sort all lines by specified field
  * Change long string to multiple lines with the given max length.

## 3. String Search/Replace
  * Search by wildcard(?,\*)

## 4. Programming
  * Generate class with given fields

Create a website which collects all classic codes as best practice.
For example: string empty check in java, javascript, c#
