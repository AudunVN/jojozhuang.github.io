> I plan to develop a tool which helps to create file, manipulate strings, etc. It should be cross-platform, using Node.js maybe. Here are the functionalities I can imagine.

## 1. File Creation
1) Create files with same or similar content.
2) Create files with same or similar file name.
3) Convert xml file to csv format

## 2. String Manipulation
1) Convert Base64 or vice versa.
2) Html encoding and decoding.
3) Append same string as prefix for all lines.
4) Append same string as suffix for all lines.
5) Add new line(\r\n) to each clause(eg. end with period)
6) Extract full name from each line
7) Sort all lines by specified field

## 3. String Search/Replace
1) Search by wildcard(?,\*)

## 4. Programming
1) Generate class with given fields

Create a website which collects all classic codes as best practice.
For example: string empty check in java, javascript, c#
