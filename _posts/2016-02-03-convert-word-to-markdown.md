After I setup [my personal website](http://jojozhuang.github.io/) on github, I need to post some blogs regularly. It's great to use markdown to create/edit text. It is not good to insert images and I still like to use Microsft word to edit my post first. I find a great tool to do this, [Writage](http://www.writage.com/). Actually it is a plugin for Microsoft word. You can edit docx as usual, and save it as markdown(.md) file. The styles will be kept. And for me, I like it more because it can export images automatically with the same size in word. This saves me lots of effort of editing the pictures.

Writage is easy to install, just download it from [http://www.writage.com/]http://www.writage.com/. And it requires another tool [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)

Hope you are happy to use it like me.
