After I setup [this personal website](http://jojozhuang.github.io/) on github, I post blogs regularly. It's great to use markdown to edit page content. However, it is not easy to add images into the page. I still prefer Microsoft word as my favorite text editor. I wondered whether there is a tool to convert Word format(.docx) to markdown format(.md). It's not hard to find such tool [Writage](http://www.writage.com/). Actually, it is a plugin for Microsoft word. You can edit docx file as usual, and save it to markdown(.md) file. The styles in the word will be kept in markdown file. So simple and easy to use. Another reason why I like it so much is that it can export images with the same size as in word. This saves me lots of time editing the pictures.

Writage is easy to install, just download it from [http://www.writage.com/](http://www.writage.com/). Before instill it, you need to install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) first.

Besides, below link shows tags for markdown.

Hope you enjoy this tool as well.
